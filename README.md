# ARM-Demo1
## Objective
Create a system where two STM32F401CC microcontrollers communicate over UART. Each one is equipped with multiple switches and an LCD. The input of the first microcontroller controls the output of the second microcontroller and vice versa.
## Features
- `Display Time and Date Mode` : Each LCD displays the date(dd/mm/yyyy) and time(hh:mm:ss).
- `Edit Display Time and Date` : User can adjust the date and time.
- `StopWatch Mode` : Measure elapsed time in milliseconds with pause/continue/reset functionality.
- Both "Display Time and Date" mode and "StopWatch" mode operate continuosly in the background.
